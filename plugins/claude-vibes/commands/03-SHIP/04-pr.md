# Create Pull Request

You are helping a vibe coder ship their work by creating a pull request. This is the full pipeline: commit any changes, push to remote, and create a PR for review.

## Your Role

You do the heavy lifting. Handle all git operations, generate a meaningful PR description, and create the pull request. The user doesn't need to think about git workflows—you orchestrate everything.

## How to Communicate

- Explain what's happening at each step
- Show the PR description before creating
- End with the PR URL so the user can review and share

## Context Files

**Read LOGS.json if it exists:**
Use recent entries to create a comprehensive PR description that explains:
- What was built and why
- Key decisions made
- How to test the changes

## PR Process

### 1. Check Current State

Run `git status` and `git log` to understand:
- Uncommitted changes?
- What branch are we on?
- How many commits since branching from dev?

**If on dev or main:**
"You're on the `dev` branch. Create a feature branch first, then come back."
- Use AskUserQuestion to get branch name
- Create the branch

### 2. Commit Uncommitted Changes

**If uncommitted changes exist:**
1. Analyze changes with `git diff`
2. Check LOGS.json for context
3. Generate commit message
4. Execute commit

"Committing your changes first..."

### 3. Push to Remote

Ensure all commits are pushed:
```bash
git push -u origin <current-branch>
```

"Pushing to remote..."

### 4. Gather PR Context

Understand what this PR contains:
- Run `git log dev..HEAD` to see all commits
- Run `git diff dev...HEAD` to see all changes
- Read LOGS.json for detailed context

### 5. Generate PR Description

Create a PR with this format:

```markdown
## Summary

[2-3 bullet points explaining what this PR does and why]

## Changes

[List of key changes, grouped logically]

## Testing

[How to verify these changes work]

## Notes

[Any context reviewers should know]

**Example:**
```markdown
## Summary

- Adds user authentication with email/password login
- Implements session management with secure cookies
- Adds protected routes that require login

## Changes

**Authentication:**
- Added NextAuth configuration with credentials provider
- Created login and signup pages
- Added auth middleware for protected routes

**Database:**
- Added User model with password hashing
- Created session storage schema

## Testing

1. Go to /signup and create an account
2. Log out and log back in at /login
3. Try accessing /dashboard without logging in (should redirect)

## Notes

- Uses bcrypt for password hashing
- Sessions expire after 7 days
```

### 6. Create the PR

Use GitHub CLI:
```bash
gh pr create --base dev --title "<title>" --body "<description>"
```

Default target branch: `dev`

PR title: Use $ARGUMENTS if provided, otherwise generate from commits.

### 7. Report Success

"Pull request created!"

- PR URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`
- Title: `feat: add user authentication`
- Target: `dev`
- Commits: 5

"Share this link for review, or merge when ready."

## Guidelines

- Default target is `dev` branch
- Never create PRs to `main` without explicit confirmation
- Include comprehensive descriptions using LOGS.json
- Always include testing instructions
- Add the Claude Code footer

## PR Title (If Generating)

Generate title from the commits:
- If single purpose: `feat: add user authentication`
- If multiple commits: Use the primary change as title

User-provided title: $ARGUMENTS

## Edge Cases

**PR already exists:**
"A PR already exists for this branch."
- Show the existing PR URL
- Ask if user wants to update it

**No commits to include:**
"This branch has no new commits compared to dev. Nothing to create a PR for."

**Target branch behind:**
"The dev branch has new commits. Consider rebasing first."
- Use AskUserQuestion: "Should I rebase your branch on the latest dev?"

**PR to main:**
If user explicitly requests PR to main:
"Creating a PR directly to main. This will go to production. Are you sure?"
- Require explicit confirmation
