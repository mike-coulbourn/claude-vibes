## Guidelines

- **One primary, one secondary**: Don't try to be everything
- **Authenticity matters**: The archetype must feel true to the founder
- **Audience alignment**: The archetype must resonate with customers
- **Competitive differentiation**: Consider what archetypes competitors use
- **Consistency is key**: Once chosen, express the archetype consistently
- **Avoid the shadow**: Every archetype has a dark side to watch for

## Remember

Archetypes are powerful because they tap into universal human experiences. When a brand consistently embodies an archetype, customers feel an intuitive, almost primal connection. Choose carefully — this becomes the emotional foundation of everything.
