# Brand Archetype Selection Framework

Quick reference for selecting brand archetypes using the Mark-Pearson methodology and Jungian psychology.

> "Archetypes are the heartbeat of a brand because they convey a meaning that makes customers relate to a product as if it actually were alive in some way." — Margaret Mark & Carol Pearson

## Psychological Foundations

### Why Archetypes Work

Carl Jung proposed that beyond our personal unconscious lies a **collective unconscious**—a shared psychological inheritance containing archetypes: universal symbols, themes, and characters that appear across all human societies.

**Key Insights:**
1. **Subconscious Pattern Recognition**: Our brains respond to archetypal stories as deeply familiar
2. **The 95% Rule**: According to Harvard Professor Gerald Zaltman, 95% of purchasing decisions are made subconsciously
3. **Mirror Neuron Response**: When encountering clear archetypal expression, our mirror neurons fire as if we were embodying that archetype ourselves
4. **Archetypes bypass the intellectual mind** and produce feelings that lead to brand loyalty

### The Business Case

A six-year Young & Rubicam study found that **brands most clearly aligned with a single archetype were the most profitable**.

---

## The 70/30 Rule (Core Methodology)

**Primary Archetype (70%)**: Your core personality that represents the majority of your brand. Any less and your personality will be confusing—you'll struggle to connect through familiarity.

**Secondary "Influencer" Archetype (30%)**: Left to spend on differentiation. This is where you stand out from competitors who share your primary archetype.

### Strategic Choice
- **Align with industry expectation** (safety, meets customer expectations)
- **Go against the grain** (differentiation opportunity, but riskier)

## The Four Motivation Quadrants

The 12 archetypes are organized into four fundamental human motivations:

| **Independence & Fulfillment** | The yearning for paradise | Hero, Outlaw, Explorer, Sage |
| **Mastery & Risk** | Leaving a thumbprint on the world | Magician, Creator |
| **Belonging & Enjoyment** | No one is an island | Lover, Jester |

**A - Align** with your business goals and ideal client
**D - Decide** on primary (dominant) and secondary (influencer) archetypes

## Industry Default Archetypes

| Industry | Default Archetype | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Healthcare | Caregiver | Expected; breaking from this is risky but differentiating |
| Finance | Sage or Ruler | Trust and expertise expected |
| Technology | Creator or Magician | Innovation and transformation |
| Luxury | Ruler or Lover | Status and desire |
| Outdoor/Adventure | Explorer | Freedom and discovery |
| Sports/Fitness | Hero | Achievement and overcoming |
| Entertainment | Jester or Magician | Fun and transformation |
| Food (comfort) | Caregiver or Everyman | Nourishment and belonging |

## Archetype Combinations

### Complementary (These Work Well)

| Primary | Secondary | Effect | Example |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Ruler | Creator | Authority with innovation | Chanel |
| Outlaw | Explorer | Rebellion with adventure | Roxy |
| Everyman | Lover | Welcoming with emotional depth | Airbnb |
| Sage | Magician | Wisdom with transformation | TED |
| Hero | Caregiver | Strength with compassion | Healthcare brands |
| Creator | Sage | Innovation with expertise | Adobe |

### Problematic (Use with Caution)

|-------------|----------|
| Jester + Ruler | Playfulness vs. authority |
| Innocent + Outlaw | Purity vs. rebellion |
| Sage + Jester | Wisdom vs. playfulness |
| Ruler + Everyman | Exclusivity vs. accessibility |
| Caregiver + Outlaw | Nurturing vs. disruption |

| **Awareness** | Differentiating archetype | Rebel energy to stand out |
| **Sales** | Expertise archetype | Sage energy to build trust |
| **Support** | Comfort archetype | Caregiver energy to nurture |

## Common Mistakes & Anti-Patterns

| # | Mistake | The Fix |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | **Trying to Be Everything** (too many archetypes) | Commit to one primary; use secondary sparingly |
| 2 | **Inconsistent Application** | Every touchpoint must reflect archetype |
| 3 | **Ignoring Your Audience** | Must align with customer expectations and desires |
| 4 | **Overused Without Differentiation** | Add secondary archetype for uniqueness |
| 5 | **Ignoring Shadow Sides** | Understand and mitigate archetype weaknesses |
| 6 | **Making It Too Rigid** | Allow room for growth and adaptation |
| 7 | **Cultural Blindness** | Vet archetypes for target cultural context |

---

## Shadow Sides (Weaknesses to Avoid)

| Archetype | Shadow Side | What to Avoid |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Innocent | Naive, in denial | Seeming out of touch with reality |
| Everyman | Bland, forgettable | No distinctive point of view |
| Hero | Arrogant, aggressive | Putting others down, being preachy |
| Outlaw | Destructive, alienating | Rebellion without purpose |
| Explorer | Aimless, flaky | Unable to commit or be relied upon |
| Creator | Perfectionist, impractical | Dismissive of execution details |
| Ruler | Tyrannical, elitist | Appearing arrogant or inaccessible |
| Magician | Manipulative, over-promising | Smoke and mirrors, undeliverable claims |
| Lover | Obsessive, shallow | Desperate for approval, purely superficial |
| Caregiver | Martyring, smothering | Making customers feel incompetent |
| Sage | Condescending, disconnected | Talking down, ivory-tower thinking |
| Jester | Irresponsible, offensive | Humor that punches down, inability to be serious |

---

## Selection Validation Tests

Apply these tests before finalizing archetype selection:

| Test | Question | Pass Criteria |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Authenticity Test** | Does this feel true to the founder/brand? | Resonates deeply, not forced |
| **Audience Test** | Does this archetype resonate with our customers? | Matches their emotional needs |
| **Differentiation Test** | Does this stand out from competitors? | Not the same as direct competitors |
| **Consistency Test** | Can we express this across all touchpoints? | Translates to voice, visuals, experience |
| **Longevity Test** | Will this still fit in 5-10 years? | Not tied to trends, core to identity |
| **Shadow Test** | Can we avoid the archetype's dark side? | Have plan to mitigate weaknesses |

## Differentiating Within an Archetype

When competitors share your archetype:

1. **Add a secondary archetype** for unique flavor
2. **Go deeper into sub-archetypes** — find unique angle within archetype
3. **Own specific territories** — causes, aesthetics, customer segments
4. **Develop unique voice** within archetype — Nike vs. FedEx are both Hero

---

## Key Principles

### From Mark & Pearson
- "Archetypes are the heartbeat of a brand"
- Discover the "soul" of your brand through archetypal analysis
- Express that soul in ways that tap into universal stories
- Achieve iconic brand identity that withstands time

### From Neumeier
- "A brand is not what you say it is. It's what they say it is."
- Focus on differentiation and "onliness"
- Archetypes are one tool in the toolkit, not the entire strategy

### Core Truths
1. **Archetypes are shortcuts to meaning** — they accelerate emotional connection
2. **Consistency compounds** — consistent expression builds trust (up to 23% revenue increase)
3. **Primary archetype clarity beats complexity** — one clear archetype outperforms blends
4. **Archetypes must be authentic** — forcing misalignment creates dissonance
5. **Differentiation happens at the edges** — same archetype, different expression
