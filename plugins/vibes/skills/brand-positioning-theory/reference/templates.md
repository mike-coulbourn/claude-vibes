## ZAG Opportunity Template

```
### ZAG Opportunity Analysis

---

#### The ZIG (What Everyone Does)

**What competitors all do:**
[Describe the common approach in the space]

**The conventional wisdom:**
[What the industry believes is "how it's done"]

**Where they all cluster:**
[The crowded positioning territory]

---

#### The ZAG (The Radical Differentiation)

**The opportunity:**
[What no one is doing that creates value]

**Why this ZAG works:**
- **Relevant**: [How it serves audience need]
- **Credible**: [Why we can deliver]
- **Different**: [Why no one else does this]
- **Trend-aligned**: [What trend it rides]

---

#### The Four Elements Applied

| Element | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **Focus** | [How we're narrowing] |
| **Differentiation** | [How we're radically different] |
| **Trend** | [What wave we're riding] |
| **Communication** | [How we'll surround with compelling messages] |

---

#### ZAG Validation

- [ ] Is this genuinely different (not just incremental)?
- [ ] Does it create a new category or redefine existing?
- [ ] Is it sustainable (can we defend this territory)?
- [ ] Is it scalable (can we grow from here)?
- [ ] Does it ride a meaningful trend?
```

| [What we'll say] | [What we WON'T say] | [Why this trade-off] |
| [What we'll say] | [What we WON'T say] | [Why this trade-off] |

---

#### The Anti-Positioning

---

#### Sacrifice Validation
