---

#### Proposed Values to Categorize

List all potential values identified:
1. _______________
2. _______________
3. _______________
4. _______________
5. _______________

---

#### Category Assessment

For each value, determine which category it belongs to:

| Value | Core? | Aspirational? | Permission-to-Play? | Accidental? |
|-------|-------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| [Value 1] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| [Value 2] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| [Value 3] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

---

#### Core Values (Non-Negotiable)

Values checked as Core:
1. _______________________________________________
2. _______________________________________________
3. _______________________________________________

**Validation**: For each, answer: "Is this currently true, not aspirational?"

| Core Value | Currently True? | Evidence |
|------------|-----------------|----------|
| [Value 1] | Y/N | |
| [Value 2] | Y/N | |
| [Value 3] | Y/N | |

---

#### Aspirational Values (Where We're Heading)

Values checked as Aspirational:

---

#### Permission-to-Play Values (Table Stakes)

Values checked as Permission-to-Play:

Values checked as Accidental:
1. _______________________________________________

**Action**: Decide whether to keep, discard, or intentionally cultivate
```

## Differentiation Test Template

Apply all six tests to ensure values are distinctive.

```
### Differentiation Test Results

**Value Being Tested**: _______________________________________________

---

#### Test 1: The Opposite Test

**Question**: Could a reasonable company hold the opposite value?

The opposite of this value is: _______________________________________________

Could a company legitimately claim this opposite?
[ ] Yes — This IS a distinctive value
[ ] No — This is NOT distinctive (table stakes)

**Examples of companies with opposite**: _______________________________________________

---

#### Test 2: The Antivalue/Sacrifice Test

**Question**: What do we give up to live this value?

To live [value], we sacrifice: _______________________________________________

Could another company value what we sacrifice?
[ ] Yes — This IS a distinctive trade-off
[ ] No — No real sacrifice, not distinctive

**Company that values our antivalue**: _______________________________________________

---

#### Test 3: The Onlyness Test

**Complete the sentence**:

"We are the only [category] that [benefit from this value]"

We are the only _______________ that _______________________________________________

**Can competitors make this same claim?**
[ ] No — This IS distinctive
[ ] Yes — Need to sharpen

---

#### Test 4: The Hard Choice Test

**Question**: Does this value help make hard decisions?

**Scenario**: Describe a situation where this value would force a difficult trade-off:

_______________________________________________

**Would we actually make that choice?**
[ ] Yes, we would/have — This IS a real value
[ ] Probably not — This is aspirational only

**Example of hard choice made**: _______________________________________________

---

#### Test 5: The Behavioral Specificity Test

**Question**: What does this value look like in practice?

**Generic expression** (what everyone says):
_______________________________________________

**Our specific expression** (what we actually do):
_______________________________________________

**Is ours specific enough?**
[ ] Yes — Concrete and observable
[ ] No — Needs more specificity

---

#### Test 6: The Fire Someone Test

**Question**: Would we fire a high performer who violated this value?

[ ] Yes — This IS a core value
[ ] No — This is NOT truly core

**Evidence/Reasoning**: _______________________________________________

---

#### Test Summary

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Opposite Test | Pass/Fail | |
| Antivalue/Sacrifice | Pass/Fail | |
| Onlyness Test | Pass/Fail | |
| Hard Choice Test | Pass/Fail | |
| Behavioral Specificity | Pass/Fail | |
| Fire Someone Test | Pass/Fail | |

**Overall Verdict**:
[ ] **DISTINCTIVE** — Passes 5-6 tests
[ ] **NEEDS WORK** — Passes 3-4 tests, refine wording
[ ] **NOT DISTINCTIVE** — Passes 0-2 tests, replace or eliminate
```
