# Brand Voice Development Framework

Quick reference for developing brand voice and verbal identity using established methodologies from leading voice strategists.

> "You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a meeting with your boss." — Mailchimp Content Style Guide

## Key Distinction: Voice vs. Tone

| Concept | Definition | Consistency |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Voice** | Brand's personality expressed through language | Always consistent |
| **Tone** | How voice adapts to different contexts | Varies by situation |

**Analogy**: You have the same voice whether talking to your boss or your friends — but your tone changes.

---

## Core Methodologies

### 1. Bloomstein's Message Architecture & BrandSort

**Created by**: Margot Bloomstein

**The Process**:
1. **Sort attribute cards into three piles**:
   - "Who you are" (current perception)
   - "Who you'd like to be" (aspirational)
   - "Who you're NOT" (actively rejected)
2. **Prioritize**: From "who you'd like to be," create hierarchy of 8-12 attributes
3. **Unpack abstract terms**: Make "innovative" or "trustworthy" concrete
4. **Content audit**: Evaluate existing content against the architecture

**Key Principle**: Balance user needs with brand identity — being exclusively user-focused leads to bland sameness.

### 2. Nielsen Norman Group's Four Dimensions of Tone

Research-backed framework for plotting voice position:

| Dimension | Spectrum | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Formality** | Formal ←→ Casual | "We appreciate your inquiry" vs "Hey, good question!" |
| **Humor** | Serious ←→ Funny | Straightforward vs witty |
| **Reverence** | Respectful ←→ Irreverent | Traditional vs rule-breaking |
| **Energy** | Matter-of-fact ←→ Enthusiastic | Neutral vs excited |

**Application**:
- Plot intended position on each dimension
- A brand CAN be serious AND casual (like a friendly financial advisor)
- Avoid landing exactly in the middle on all dimensions — that's generic

**Research Finding**: Casual, conversational tone increased trustworthiness by 0.3 points on a 5-point scale.

---

### 3. Aaker's Brand Personality Dimensions

The most influential academic framework (Stanford, 1997):

| Dimension | Sub-Traits |
|-----------|------------|
| **Sincerity** | Down-to-earth, honest, wholesome, cheerful |
| **Excitement** | Daring, spirited, imaginative, up-to-date |
| **Competence** | Reliable, intelligent, successful |
| **Sophistication** | Upper class, charming, glamorous |
| **Ruggedness** | Outdoorsy, tough, masculine |

**Usage**: Identify 1-2 primary dimensions for your brand as starting point.

---

### 4. "This But Not That" Technique

Used by Slack to add nuance and prevent misinterpretation:

| Voice Attribute | Constraint | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| Confident | but not cocky | Sets boundary on confidence |
| Witty | but not silly | Humor with purpose |
| Friendly | but not ingratiating | Warmth without being desperate |
| Conversational | but always appropriate | Casual yet professional |
| Intelligent | and treats users as intelligent | Respects the audience |

**Key Principle**: The "not that" constraint prevents common misinterpretations.

## Complete Verbal Identity System

A comprehensive verbal identity includes 8 components:

| # | Component | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Voice Attributes** | 3-5 core traits with definitions and "this but not that" refinements |
| 2 | **Tone Guidelines** | How voice adapts across contexts, channels, emotional states |
| 3 | **Messaging Architecture** | Purpose, value propositions, elevator pitch, key messages |
| 4 | **Naming Conventions** | Product/feature naming system, hierarchy |
| 5 | **Verbal Distinctive Assets** | Ownable phrases, signature words, coined terms |
| 6 | **Vocabulary Guidelines** | Words to use/avoid, jargon policy, inclusive language |
| 7 | **Grammar & Mechanics** | Sentence structure, punctuation, contractions, emoji policy |
| 8 | **Examples Library** | Before/after rewrites, good/bad examples, templates |

---

## Tone Adaptation Framework

### Tone Matrix by Channel

| Channel | Tone Adjustment |
|---------|----------------|
| Social Media | More casual, engaging, playful |
| Marketing/Ads | Confident, benefit-focused |
| Customer Support | Empathetic, helpful, clear |
| Legal/Compliance | More formal, precise |
| Product UI | Concise, action-oriented |

### Tone by Emotional State (Mailchimp's Approach)

| Reader's State | Tone Response |
|----------------|---------------|
| **Happy/successful** | Match their energy, celebrate |
| **Confused** | Be patient, clear, helpful |
| **Frustrated/angry** | Be empathetic first, then helpful |
| **Anxious** | Be reassuring, concrete, specific |

### Slack's 5 Copy Principles

1. **Be clear and simple** — Aim for comprehension
2. **Anticipate (and answer!) the readers' questions** — Be relevant
3. **Be intentionally playful and bold** — Delight without distracting
4. **Build appropriate emotional connection** — Be generous with warmth
5. **Help people envision the possibilities of a better future**

The best copy demonstrates at least 3 of these 5 principles.

## Voice vs. Messaging vs. Positioning

These are often confused. Clear distinctions:

| Element | Definition | Answers | Scope |
|---------|------------|---------|-------|
| **Positioning** | Strategic foundation for perception | "Why choose us?" | Internal strategy |
| **Messaging** | Content and narratives communicating positioning | "What do we say?" | External content |
| **Voice** | Personality and style in which you communicate | "How do we say it?" | Applied everywhere |

**How They Work Together**:
- Positioning determines WHAT makes you different
- Messaging translates that into WHAT you say
- Voice determines HOW you say everything

## Common Mistakes & Anti-Patterns

| # | Mistake | Pattern | Fix |
|---|---------|---------|-----|
| 1 | **Being Generic** | "Innovative, customer-focused, passionate" | Use the "airport test" — recognizable without logo? |
| 2 | **Inconsistency** | Different teams, different styles | Central guidelines, train all teams, voice champions |
| 3 | **Stripping Personality** | Product specs overwhelming message | Voice makes complexity simple |
| 4 | **Copying Trends** | Everyone trying to sound like Oatly | Ground in authentic brand values |
| 5 | **Ignoring Audience** | Voice reflects company, not customer | Research audience preferences first |
| 6 | **Vague Guidelines** | "Be friendly" without definition | Add concrete dos/don'ts with examples |
| 7 | **Create Then Forget** | No enforcement or monitoring | Regular audits, ongoing training, metrics |
| 8 | **Ignoring AI Era** | Guidelines don't work with AI | Create AI-specific guidelines with prompts |

## Workshop Exercises

### Exercise 1: Adjective Card Sort (15 min)
Sort attributes into "You Are," "You Are Torn," "You Are Not." The "Not" pile is as valuable as "Are."

### Exercise 2: Sliding Scale Spectrums (10 min)
Place brand on spectrums: Conservative ←→ Extravagant, Fun ←→ Serious, Traditional ←→ Modern.

### Exercise 3: Brand as a Person (15 min)
Questions: What would they do for work? Wear? Never say? Who would they befriend? What annoys them?

### Exercise 4: Content Audit (20 min)
Review 10 recent pieces. Read aloud. What feels authentic? What makes you wince?

### Exercise 5: Competitive Voice Analysis (20 min)
Review competitors' communications. Identify patterns. Find differentiation opportunities.

## Brand Voice in the AI Era

### The Challenge
AI produces content at scale, but without clear voice instructions, output sounds generic.

### Solutions

**AI-Specific Guidelines**:
- Distill voice into 3-5 adjectives with explanations
- Provide extensive examples
- Include prompts that work with your voice

**Custom GPT Instructions**:
- Build assistants with pre-set voice parameters
- Upload documentation, samples, approved phrasing
- Test outputs and refine

**Human Oversight**:
- AI doesn't understand brand history or nuance
- Always review before publishing
- Use AI for drafts, humans for refinement

---

## Key Statistics

- **Tone impacts trust**: Casual tone increased trustworthiness by 0.3 points (Nielsen Norman Group)
- **Voice drives conversion**: Monzo achieved 500% increase in overdraft uptake through messaging
- **Voice affects downloads**: Monzo's optimized copy led to 15% jump in app download clicks
