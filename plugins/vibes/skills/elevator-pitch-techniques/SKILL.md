## The 6 Core Frameworks

### 1. StoryBrand Framework (SB7) — Donald Miller

**Core Principle:** "Your business is not the hero of your brand story. Your customer is."

| Step | Element | Question |
|------|---------|----------|
| 1 | **Character** | What does your customer WANT? |
| 2 | **Problem** | What PROBLEM stands in their way? (External, internal, philosophical) |
| 3 | **Guide** | How does your brand act as their GUIDE? |
| 4 | **Plan** | What STEPS do they need to follow? |
| 5 | **Call to Action** | What ACTION should they take? |
| 6 | **Success** | What SUCCESS will they achieve? |
| 7 | **Failure** | What FAILURE do you help them avoid? |

**Template:**
> "For [target customer] who [has this problem], [your brand] helps you [achieve desired outcome] by [your unique approach]. Unlike [alternatives], we [key differentiator]."

**When to Use:** Customer transformation is central to brand story.

---

### 2. Sparkline Framework — Nancy Duarte

**Core Principle:** Great communicators create tension by contrasting "what is" with "what could be."

**The Process:**
1. Start with **"What Is"** — the current painful reality
2. Contrast with **"What Could Be"** — the better future
3. Alternate between the two throughout your pitch
4. End with **"New Bliss"** — the transformed state

**Application:**
- **What Is:** "Competition is becoming more ferocious..."
- **What Could Be:** "...but we can disrupt that competition with a new approach."

**The S.T.A.R. Moment:** Create **S**omething **T**hey'll **A**lways **R**emember — a moment so memorable it sticks long after the pitch ends.

**When to Use:** Contrast between current/future state is powerful.

---

### 3. CLARITY Framework — Chris Westfall

**Core Principle:** Deliver a message that makes your listener say "Tell me more..."

| Letter | Element | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **C** | Captivate | Hook attention immediately |
| **L** | Language | Use clear, jargon-free words |
| **A** | Authenticity | Be true to yourself and your listener |
| **R** | Relevance | Make it matter to THIS audience |
| **I** | Inspiration | Connect to bigger purpose |
| **T** | Tact | Read the room and adapt |
| **Y** | Yes! | Find agreement and next steps |

**When to Use:** When authenticity and audience connection are priorities.

---

### 4. Onlyness Statement — Marty Neumeier

**Core Principle:** If you can't say why you're different and compelling in a few words, fix your company, not your positioning statement.

**The Formula:**
> "Our brand is the ONLY __________ that __________."

First blank: Your category
Second blank: Your compelling difference

**Extended Version:**
> "For [ideal customers], [your brand name] is the only [category] that [benefit] [how]."

**Example:**
> "Cirque du Soleil is the only circus with Broadway sophistication."

**When to Use:** Category position is the key differentiator.

---

### 5. Golden Circle — Simon Sinek

**Core Principle:** "People don't buy WHAT you do; they buy WHY you do it."

**The Three Circles (inside out):**
1. **WHY** — Purpose, cause, belief (core)
2. **HOW** — Methods, values, differentiators (middle)
3. **WHAT** — Products, services, features (outer)

**Application:**
- ❌ Wrong: "We make great computers."
- ✅ Right: "We believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we do this is by making our products beautifully designed and simple to use. We happen to make great computers."

**When to Use:** Purpose is the primary differentiator.

---

### 6. Strategic Narrative — Andy Raskin

**Core Principle:** The most effective pitches never start by talking about yourself. They start by naming a big shift in the world.

**The 5 Elements:**

| Step | Element | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Name the Change** | What major shift is happening in the world? |
| 2 | **Show Stakes** | What's at risk if you ignore this shift? |
| 3 | **Tease Promised Land** | What does the future look like for those who adapt? |
| 4 | **Magic Gifts** | Your product as the tool for transformation |
| 5 | **Present Proof** | Evidence that this journey succeeds |

**Positioning:** "Your prospect is Luke and you're Obi Wan, or your prospect is Frodo and you're Gandalf."

**Never Start With:** Your product, headquarters, investors, clients, or anything about yourself.

**When to Use:** There's a big industry shift to leverage.

## The 6 Hook Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Surprising Statistic** | Lead with unexpected data | "Did you know that 78% of..." |
| **Thought-Provoking Question** | Create instant engagement | "Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life?" (Steve Jobs) |
| **Bold Statement** | Counterintuitive claim | "Most companies are doing [X] completely wrong..." |
| **Quick Analogy** | Instant understanding | "We're the Netflix of [category]" |
| **Story/Anecdote** | Relatable scenario | "Imagine you're [situation]..." |
| **The Contrast** | Unexpected juxtaposition | "What if I told you the biggest problem isn't X, it's Y?" |

### The S.T.A.R. Moment

Create **S**omething **T**hey'll **A**lways **R**emember:
- A dramatic statistic
- An evocative analogy
- A memorable demonstration
- A shocking statement
- A powerful visual

---

## Time-Based Pitch Structures

### One-Liner (10 seconds)

The briefest explanation — for casual encounters and "What do you do?" moments.

**Template (Founder Institute):**
> "My company, [name], is developing [a defined offering] to help [a defined audience] [solve a problem] with [secret sauce]."

**Purpose:** Quick establishment, create intrigue, open door for follow-up.

---

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

The classic format — approximately **75-120 words**.

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (5 sec) — Grab attention
2. **Problem** (7 sec) — What your customer struggles with
3. **Solution** (8 sec) — How you help
4. **Differentiation** (7 sec) — What's unique
5. **Interest Close** (3 sec) — Invite follow-up

---

### Extended Pitch (60 seconds)

More depth — approximately **150-200 words**.

**Adds to 30-second version:**
- More detailed storytelling
- A client example or proof point
- Deeper emotional connection

---

### Founder Story Pitch

When founder background adds credibility or emotional connection.

**Use when:**
- Founder background is compelling/relevant
- Authenticity matters to audience
- The origin story demonstrates insight

## Verbal Delivery Techniques

### The 3 C's of Delivery

| C | Element | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Clarity** | Easy to understand |
| 2 | **Conciseness** | Brief enough for 30-60 seconds |
| 3 | **Confidence** | Delivered with assurance |

### Tone

- For brand pitches: **warm, confident, passionate** (not salesy)
- Match tone to content and context
- The same words can sound curious, decisive, or dismissive

### Pacing

- Target: **conversational pace (~120 words/minute)**
- Speaking too fast muddles your message — slow down
- Talking slower emphasizes important or complicated parts

### Strategic Pauses

- Create anticipation **before** key points
- Allow information to **sink in**
- Emphasize important statements by **pausing after** them
- Don't underestimate the **power of silence**

### Sounding Natural vs. Rehearsed

- Practice with **bullet points, NOT a memorized script**
- Make **gradual** changes in tone, pitch, and pace
- Inflection must be **"organic"** — you cannot fake it
- Record yourself and listen for **robotic patterns**

> "The best elevator pitch isn't polished or memorized, like a college final exam. It's natural and sporadic, like chatting up a good friend you haven't seen in months." — Seth Godin

## Brand vs. Investor Pitch

| Aspect | Investor Pitch | Brand/Marketing Pitch |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Focus** | Data-driven, metrics | Story-driven, emotion |
| **Content** | Market opportunity, traction | Value proposition, transformation |
| **Numbers** | Financial projections | Customer benefits, outcomes |
| **Length** | 10-20 minutes detailed | 30-60 seconds conversational |
| **Goal** | Secure funding | Spark interest, create connection |
| **Hero** | The company/founders | The customer |
| **Proof** | Revenue, users, growth | Testimonials, transformations |

### Brand Pitch Must-Haves

1. **Emotional Connection** — Stories make people feel; data makes them zone out
2. **Customer as Hero** — Their transformation, not your features
3. **Clear Value Proposition** — What makes you the "only" one?
4. **Authenticity** — Your brand's genuine purpose and values
5. **Memorable Hook** — Surprising fact, question, or vivid analogy

## 14 Common Mistakes

### Content Mistakes

| # | Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---|---------|---------|-----|
| 1 | **Too Vague or Generic** | Could apply to any company | Be radically specific about your value |
| 2 | **Focusing on Yourself** | Customers care how you help THEM | Lead with their problem |
| 3 | **Industry Jargon** | Alienates non-experts | Use words a smart friend would understand |
| 4 | **Overused Buzzwords** | Sounds presumptuous | Avoid: "synergies," "empowering," "revolutionary," "disruptive" |
| 5 | **Not Explaining Value** | Features without benefits | Focus on what they GET |

### Delivery Mistakes

| # | Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---|---------|---------|-----|
| 6 | **Too Long or Complex** | Loses attention (8-second span) | Stick to 3 key points maximum |
| 7 | **Too Salesy or Pushy** | Alienates listeners | Focus on value, not selling |
| 8 | **Speaking Too Fast** | Muddles message | Slow down, breathe, pause |
| 9 | **Unprepared or Nervous** | Fumbling, forgetting | Practice to be confident, not robotic |
| 10 | **Failing to Engage** | No connection | Eye contact, read reactions, adapt |

### Structural Mistakes

| # | Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---|---------|---------|-----|
| 11 | **No Time for Response** | Pitch was worthless | Always end with space for dialogue |
| 12 | **No Clear Next Step** | Conversation dies | End with specific, simple ask |
| 13 | **Not Adapting** | One-size-fits-all fails | Tailor to context and audience |
| 14 | **Starting with Yourself** | Loses them immediately | Start with the problem or change |

## 7-Day Testing & Iteration Framework

| Day | Activity | Focus |
|-----|----------|-------|
| 1 | Draft initial pitch | Get something down |
| 2-3 | Practice out loud, refine | Smooth the wording |
| 4 | Get feedback, tweak | Input from trusted people |
| 5 | Test in real conversations | Track responses |
| 6 | Review what worked | Iterate on CTA |
| 7 | Finalize + document 2 backup variants | Ready to deploy |

### How to Test

1. **Read out loud** — Does it sound natural?
2. **Time yourself** — Is it the right length?
3. **Share with trusted people** — What do they remember most?
4. **Test with different audiences** — How does each respond?
5. **Use at real events** — Do they ask follow-ups?

### Measuring Effectiveness

- Track number of follow-up conversations
- Count referrals or opportunities generated
- Note which parts generate the most interest or questions
- Watch for the "tell me more" reaction

## Real Brand Example Patterns

### Airbnb Pattern

> "Tired of expensive hotels and lame vacation rentals? With Airbnb, you can affordably book unique homes and spaces from local hosts for your next trip. We're like the eBay of accommodations—our community already has over 2 million listings worldwide."

**Structure:** Problem → Solution → Analogy → Proof

---

### Dropbox Pattern

> "Tired of emailing files to yourself to access them from different computers and devices? Dropbox is a service that creates a shared folder accessible from anywhere—your desktop, laptop, phone, and the web. Any files you save to it are automatically synced and backed up in the cloud."

**Structure:** Relatable problem → Simple solution → Clear benefit

---

### SpaceX Pattern

> "Do you know how crazy expensive it is to launch stuff into space? Well, SpaceX builds affordable rockets and spacecraft to make space exploration and travel possible for everyone—not just governments."

**Structure:** Bold question → Mission statement → Democratization angle

---

### What Makes These Work

1. **Start with relatable problem** — "Tired of..." or provocative question
2. **Use simple, jargon-free language** — Anyone can understand
3. **Include quick analogy** — "like the eBay of..."
4. **Provide proof** — Numbers, traction, scale
5. **Clear value proposition** — What you get is obvious

---

## CTA Options by Context

### For Meetings/Calls

- "Would you mind if I set up a quick call next week to discuss this further?"
- "I'd love to grab coffee and hear more about your work. Would that be possible?"

### For Interest/Demo

- "Would you be open to a quick demo?"
- "If you want to learn more, you can [specific next step]."

### For Connection

- "Could I get your card and follow up by email?"
- "Would it be okay if I sent you some more information?"

**Key Principle:** Make the ask simple with little required on their part — you just met this person.
