# Golden Circle Purpose Framework

Quick reference for purpose-driven brand building using Simon Sinek's Golden Circle methodology and complementary frameworks from Jim Collins, David Aaker, and Marty Neumeier.

> "People don't buy what you do, they buy WHY you do it." — Simon Sinek

## The Golden Circle

```
            ┌───────────────┐
            │     WHY       │ ← Purpose, cause, belief (LIMBIC BRAIN)
            │ ┌───────────┐ │
            │ │    HOW    │ │ ← Values, process, differentiators (LIMBIC BRAIN)
            │ │ ┌───────┐ │ │
            │ │ │ WHAT  │ │ │ ← Products, services, features (NEOCORTEX)
            │ │ └───────┘ │ │
            │ └───────────┘ │
            └───────────────┘
```

| Circle | Definition | Brain Region |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| **WHY** | Purpose, cause, belief — why you exist | Limbic (emotions, decisions) |
| **HOW** | Unique approach, values, differentiators | Limbic (emotions, decisions) |
| **WHAT** | Products, services, tangible proof | Neocortex (rational thought) |

**The Core Insight**: Leading with WHY speaks directly to the decision-making part of the brain.

## WHY Statement Format

**Structure**: "To _____ so that _____"

- **First blank** = Your contribution (the action you take)
- **Second blank** = Your impact (the difference you make)

**Examples**:
- **Simon Sinek**: "To inspire people to do the things that inspire them so that, together, we can change our world"
- **Airbnb**: "To connect millions of people in real life all over the world so that you can Belong Anywhere"

**Key Principle**: You have only ONE WHY that never changes. Purpose is discovered, not invented.

---

## WHY Discovery Process Quick Reference

**From Simon Sinek, David Mead, Peter Docker ("Find Your Why")**

### Step 1: Preparation
- Find a partner (not spouse/family) to listen and take notes
- Set aside 3+ hours uninterrupted
- Partner's role: ask questions, identify themes, see patterns

### Step 2: Share Stories (Peaks and Valleys)
- Plot life's significant moments on a horizontal line
- Share 10-12 specific stories
- Include childhood, career, relationships

**Memory Prompts**:
- Who has helped make you the person you are today?
- When did you say "I would have done that for free"?
- What was your worst day and why did it affect you?
- What is your earliest specific happy childhood memory?

### Step 3: Deep Questions
- Ask "what" questions (not "why" — it feels accusatory)
- "What did that mean to you?"
- "What were you feeling at that moment?"
- Don't fill silences — wait

### Step 4: Identify Themes
- Look for ideas appearing in 2+ stories
- Find "golden threads" connecting disparate experiences
- 1-2 themes will "shine brighter"

### Step 5: Draft WHY Statement
- Use "To _____ so that _____" format
- One sentence, jargon-free

## The Friends Exercise (Quick Alternative)

**From Simon Sinek — faster method when full WHY discovery isn't possible**

1. List 3-5 closest friends who will be there unconditionally
2. Ask one: "Why are we friends?"
3. Push past cliches ("you're always there") — ask "What do you really mean?"
4. Keep asking until they use feeling language: "I feel..." "You make me feel..."
5. **The indicator**: When they hit the right words, you'll feel it (goosebumps or tears)
6. Repeat with other friends, look for commonalities

## Jim Collins' Hedgehog Concept

**From "Good to Great" — find the intersection of three circles**

```
         ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
         │     DEEPLY PASSIONATE ABOUT     │
         │                                 │
         └────────────┬────────────────────┘
                      │
                      ▼
              ┌───────────────┐
              │   SWEET SPOT  │ ← The intersection
              └───────────────┘
                      ▲
         ┌───────────┴───────────────┐
         │                           │
┌────────▼────────┐       ┌─────────▼────────┐
│  BEST IN WORLD  │       │  ECONOMIC ENGINE │
│       AT        │       │                  │
└─────────────────┘       └──────────────────┘
```

| Circle | Question | Insight |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Passion** | What are you deeply passionate about? | Not what you WANT to be passionate about |
| **Excellence** | What can you be the best in the world at? | Potential for genuine excellence |
| **Economic Engine** | What drives your economics? | Single denominator with greatest impact |

**Critical**: All three circles required. Two out of three = unstable strategy.

---

## Focus Lab Purpose Testing Framework

| Element | Question | What It Tests |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Insight** | What meaningful problem do you exist to change? | The tension you address |
| **Impact** | What positive outcome do you create, and for whom? | The change you make |
| **Fit** | What distinctive capability makes your purpose credible? | Why YOU can deliver |
| **Proofs** | List 3-5 concrete actions demonstrating commitment | Evidence it's real |

**Stress-Test Questions**:
- Could a rival say this? If yes → sharpen the fit
- Can we prove it next quarter? If not → reduce claims or add proofs
- Does it apply to customer service? Products? Employee benefits? Strategy?

---

## Purpose Statement Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Use "To _____ so that _____" format
- Keep it under 15 words
- Make it timeless — avoid time-sensitive references
- Test: Can a 15-year-old explain it back?
- Ensure it guides trade-offs
- Ground it in authentic experience

### Don't

- Mention customers/stakeholders specifically
- Mention profits or revenue
- Reference products or features
- Use corporate buzzwords ("leverage," "synergize," "best-in-class")
- Make it so broad a competitor could say it
- Over-claim problems you can't solve

---

## Purpose vs Mission vs Vision

| Element | Definition | Tense | Example |
|---------|------------|-------|---------|
| **Purpose** | WHY you exist beyond profit | Timeless | "To inspire action" |
| **Mission** | WHAT you do to fulfill purpose | Present | "We create tools that empower..." |
| **Vision** | The FUTURE you're building | Future | "A world where everyone can..." |

---

## Anti-Patterns Checklist

| Anti-Pattern | What It Looks Like | The Fix |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Starting with WHAT** | Describing products, then how, never why | Lead with belief, support with proof |
| **Confusing WHY with Profit** | "To maximize shareholder value" | Money is a result, not a purpose |
| **Inventing vs Discovering** | Agency-crafted tagline without authentic connection | WHY Discovery with real stories |
| **Generic Purpose** | "Making the world a better place" | Use Insight + Impact + Fit + Proofs |
| **Purpose Washing** | Promoting cause without living it | Internal alignment before external promotion |
| **Losing the Customer** | So caught up in beliefs you forget who you serve | Connect purpose to customer value |

### Generic Purpose Red Flags

These could apply to anyone and therefore inspire no one:
- "To be the best..."
- "To provide excellent..."
- "To maximize value..."
- "To help people..." (too vague)
- "Making the world a better place"
- "Delivering value to our stakeholders"
- "Excellence in everything we do"

## Key Statistics

- **Limbic brain** controls emotions, behavior, and decision-making (no language capacity)
- **Neocortex** controls rational thought and language
- **30%** of employees have confidence their company follows through on branding commitments
- **17% more productive** — engaged employees vs non-engaged
- **20% higher sales** — purpose-aligned teams
- **41% less absenteeism** — employees who believe in the purpose

---

## Key Principles

### Purpose is Discovery, Not Invention
Your WHY comes from life experiences. You have only one WHY that never changes. The work is excavation, not creation.

### Inside-Out Communication
Inspiring organizations communicate from WHY to HOW to WHAT, not the reverse.

### Purpose Without Action is Purpose Washing
If it doesn't guide trade-offs and decisions, it's not real purpose.

### All Three Circles (Collins)
Passion + Excellence + Economic Engine. You need the intersection of all three.

### Consistency Creates Trust
Your WHY, HOW, and WHAT must align across all touchpoints.
