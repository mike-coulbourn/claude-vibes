## The Three Job Types

Every "job" customers hire a product for has three dimensions:

| Dimension | Question | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Functional** | What task are they accomplishing? | "Watch content without ads" |
| **Emotional** | How do they want to FEEL? | "Feel relaxed, avoid boredom" |
| **Social** | How do they want to be SEEN? | "Recommend shows, feel in-the-know" |

**Job Statement Format**: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]."

## The Four Forces of Progress (Bob Moesta)

Why customers switch (or don't):

```
        PROMOTING FORCES
   ┌────────────────────────────┐
   │   PUSH          PULL       │
   │   (Struggles)   (Attraction)│
   ├────────────────────────────┤
   │   HABIT         ANXIETY    │
   │   (Comfort)     (Fear)     │
   └────────────────────────────┘
        BLOCKING FORCES
```

**The Formula**: If `Push + Pull > Anxiety + Habit`, they switch.

| Force | Key Question |
|-------|-------------|
| **PUSH** | "What frustrates you about your current solution?" |
| **PULL** | "What excites you about this alternative?" |
| **ANXIETY** | "What worries you about switching?" |
| **HABIT** | "What would you miss about your current approach?" |

## Limbic Types (Hans-Georg Hausel)

Three emotional systems drive behavior:

| System | Driven By | Brand Response |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Stimulance** | Novelty, fun, exploration | Scarcity, newness |
| **Dominance** | Status, control, power | Exclusivity, prestige |
| **Balance** | Security, stability | Social proof, familiarity |

**Seven Types**: Traditionalist, Harmonizer, Open Connoisseur, Hedonist, Adventurer, Performer, Disciplined

## VALS Segments

Segments by motivation + resources:

| Motivation | High Resources | Low Resources |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Ideals** (knowledge) | Thinkers | Believers |
| **Achievement** (success) | Achievers | Strivers |
| **Self-Expression** (variety) | Experiencers | Makers |

Plus: **Innovators** (any motivation, high resources) and **Survivors** (security-focused, low resources)

## Key Principles

1. **Emotional > Functional**: Emotional jobs often drive decisions more than functional ones
2. **All Three Dimensions**: Never skip emotional and social jobs
3. **Capture the Forces**: Understanding push/pull/anxiety/habit is essential for positioning
4. **Use Their Language**: Capture actual words people use — gold for brand voice
5. **Be the Only**: "Be THE ONLY, not the best." — Marty Neumeier
