## V7 Photography Advantages

V7 significantly improves photorealistic generation:

- **Better skin textures** — Natural, detailed skin without uncanny valley
- **Improved eyes** — More realistic, properly lit eyes
- **Accurate anatomy** — Better hands, body proportions, poses
- **Lighting coherence** — More physically accurate light behavior
- **Film stock simulation** — More accurate emulation of film characteristics

**Tip**: Use `--draft` for quick iterations, then remove for final quality output.
