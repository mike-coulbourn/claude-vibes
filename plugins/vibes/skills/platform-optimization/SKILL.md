# Platform Optimization for Sponsored Content

## TikTok (2025 Algorithm Updates)

### Critical Changes
- **Watch time now weighs 5x more** than likes or comments
- **15-20 second engagement threshold** replaced old 3-5 second hook metric
- **Completion rates determine 74%** of For You Page placements
- Videos **60-180 seconds** achieve highest reach (2-3 min content drives 43.2% more views)
- Content **under 30 seconds now faces algorithmic disadvantages**

### Optimal Structure
- Hook in first **3 seconds** (71% of viewers decide here)
- Target **75%+ completion rate**
- Focus on watch time, not just likes
- Engagement velocity in first hour predicts viral potential

### TikTok Shop Affiliate Scripts
- Hook: "I can't believe this [product] actually [result]!"
- Problem-solution narrative viewers relate to
- Strong CTA: "Check the link if you want to grab one!" or "Tap the product tag"
- Optimal length: **15-30 seconds for shop, 60-90 seconds for brand deals**
- Post 5-10 high-quality videos daily for best results

### Cross-Platform Warning
**January 2025**: Cross-posted content from other platforms penalized up to **40% in reach**. Create TikTok-native content.

## Instagram Reels (2025)

### Key Ranking Factors
1. **Watch time** — Primary factor
2. **Likes per reach** — Engagement quality
3. **Shares per reach** — Especially DM shares from non-followers

### What Gets Pushed
- High saves, shares, comments
- Trending audio (doesn't need to be #1 — audio should fit the Reel's vibe)
- Strong hooks with high-quality visuals
- Content understandable without additional context

### Optimal Length
- **30-90 seconds** for engagement
- Reels up to 3 minutes supported, but shorter performs better

### Spring 2025 Update
**3-second retention prioritized above all else**. Your hook is more important than ever.

### Script Adaptations for Reels
- Visual hook even more critical than TikTok
- Slightly more polished aesthetic expected
- Captions essential (many watch without sound)
- Encourage DM shares for algorithmic boost

## YouTube Sponsorships

### Placement Options

| Placement | Best For | Tips |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **Pre-roll** | Highest visibility | Can feel intrusive; keep brief |
| **Mid-roll (30-90s)** | Highest engagement, best conversions | Most organic feel |
| **End-roll** | Post-value CTAs | Lowest attention |
| **Dedicated video** | Deep dives | Charge 3-10x usual CPM |

### Optimal Integration
- **Mid-roll placement** for highest engagement and conversions
- **30-90 second integrations** feel most natural
- Blend brand mentions into content naturally
- Focus on storytelling over selling
- **125-150 words = 1 minute** of audio
- Keep scripts **500-800 words** for longer integrations

### Paddy Galloway's Approach
1. Spend more time on pre-production than filming
2. Create "curiosity loops" throughout the video
3. Focus on Audience Retention graphs
4. The idea sets the ceiling, execution determines result

## Cross-Platform Repurposing

### The 2025 Approach
- A single 60-minute piece can become **10-15 targeted short videos**
- Tools: Opus Clip, Repurpose.io, Descript
- **39% of video marketers** report short-form generates superior ROI

### Platform Customization Required

| Platform | Optimization |
|----------|-------------|
| TikTok | Entertainment focus, trending sounds, native feel |
| Reels | Visually engaging, 30-90 seconds, aesthetic quality |
| YouTube Shorts | 15-30 seconds optimal, hook-driven |
| LinkedIn | Professional development angle |

### Critical Rule
**Don't post the same clip across platforms.** Each platform requires customization beyond aspect ratio changes.

**85% of Facebook videos** watched without sound — always add captions.

```
