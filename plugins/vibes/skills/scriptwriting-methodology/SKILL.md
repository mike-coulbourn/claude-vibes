# Scriptwriting Methodology for Sponsored Content

## Core Framework: The DR Formula

The **Direct Response (DR) Formula** is the industry standard for sponsored and affiliate video scripts:

### Structure

1. **HOOK (0-3 seconds)**: Stop the scroll
2. **PROBLEM (3-7 seconds)**: Make them feel understood
3. **SOLUTION (7-12 seconds)**: Introduce the product
4. **VALUE PROP (12-15 seconds)**: Why this product is different
5. **SOCIAL PROOF (15-18 seconds)**: Results and credibility
6. **CTA (18-20 seconds)**: Clear call to action

### Key Principle
Scripts should be **60 words or less for a 20-second video**. The structure should feel like storytelling, not advertising.

## Alternative Frameworks

### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)
Simpler structure for short-form content:

1. **Problem (15%)**: Identify the specific problem
2. **Agitate (25%)**: Intensify the pain — make them FEEL it
3. **Solution (60%)**: Present the product as the answer

**Key insight**: Agitation is the most overlooked step. "Hammering the problem home gets under the reader's skin."

### AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)
Classic framework from 1898, still effective:

1. **Attention**: Punchy hook (first 1-3 seconds)
2. **Interest**: Why should they care? What's in it for them?
3. **Desire**: Convert interest into want through emotion, social proof
4. **Action**: Clear call-to-action

### PAIPS (Problem-Agitate-Intrigue-Positive Future-Solution)
Justin Welsh's evolution of PAS:

1. **Problem**: Identify the problem
2. **Agitate**: Intensify emotional response
3. **Intrigue**: Create curiosity about the solution
4. **Positive Future**: Paint a picture of life after the problem is solved
5. **Solution**: Present your offering

## Hook Formulas

The hook is **71% of the battle**. Viewers decide to stay or scroll in 1-3 seconds.

### Proven Hook Types

| Type | Template | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Correction | "Stop doing [X]. Do this instead." | "Stop applying sunscreen like this..." |
| Insider Secret | "No one talks about this in [industry]..." | "No one talks about this in skincare..." |
| Quick Fix | "Here's how to fix [problem] in 60 seconds" | "Here's how to fix oily skin in 60 seconds" |
| Curiosity Loop | "Watch what happens when I..." | "Watch what happens when I add this to my routine" |
| Transformation | "I can't believe this [product] actually..." | "I can't believe this serum actually..." |
| Call-Out | "If you're a [person], this is for you" | "If you're over 30 with dry skin, this is for you" |
| Personal Mistake | "This mistake cost me [result]" | "This mistake cost me 6 months of breakouts" |

### Hook Stacking
Combine multiple hook types for maximum impact:
- **Visual hook**: Motion, expressions, text overlay
- **Auditory hook**: Trending audio, snappy voiceover
- **Content hook**: Bold statement, question, opinion
- **Emotional hook**: Taps into stress, joy, frustration

## CTA Best Practices

### The Data
- Affiliates who test CTAs see **49% improvement** in conversion
- CTA placement matters: End of video is standard, but mid-video CTAs can work

### CTA Templates

**Soft CTAs** (for cold audiences):
- "Link in bio if you want to check it out"
- "I'll drop the link if you're curious"

**Medium CTAs**:
- "Use my code [X] for [discount]"
- "Link in description to grab yours"

**Strong CTAs** (for warm audiences):
- "Tap the link now — this deal ends [date]"
- "Click the product tag to see the price"

### Writing Effective CTAs
1. **Keep it short**: 1-2 sentences
2. **Be specific**: Tell them exactly what to do
3. **Match urgency to context**: Don't fake scarcity
4. **Use action words**: grab, snag, check out, try

## Soft Sell vs Hard Sell

### Research Findings
- Soft sell emails get **31% positive response** vs hard sell
- Hard sell has **25% unsubscribe rate** vs 10% for soft sell
- Drip campaigns (soft sell) linked to **50% higher conversion**

### When to Use Each

**Soft Sell** (most creator content):
- Best for cold audiences
- Builds trust before asking
- Creates positive brand association

**Hard Sell**:
- Only for audiences already familiar with you
- Limited-time offers to engaged followers
- When you have one shot at closing

### The Rule
"The hardness of your sell should increase proportionally to the viewer's progression through the sales funnel."

## Hormozi's Value Equation

Use this when describing product value:

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort Required)
```

**To maximize value in your script**:
- Emphasize the dream outcome
- Build confidence it will work (social proof)
- Minimize perceived time to results
- Minimize perceived effort required
