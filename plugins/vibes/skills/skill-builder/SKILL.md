# Skill Builder

Build production-quality Skills for Claude Code with proper structure, discoverable descriptions, and best practices.

## Quick Reference

**Description Formula**: `[What it does] + [When to use it] + [Trigger terms users say]`

**Name Rules**: Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only; max 64 characters; no spaces

**Description Rules**: Max 1024 characters; must be specific with trigger terms

## The Skill Creation Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

Use AskUserQuestion to understand what they need:

1. **What should the Skill do?**
   - What capability or expertise should it provide?
   - What tasks should it help with?

2. **When should it activate?**
   - What scenarios or contexts?
   - What words/phrases would users say?
   - What file types or operations?

3. **Scope decision**
   - Personal Skill (~/.claude/skills/) - just for this user
   - Project Skill (.claude/skills/) - shared with team via git

4. **Structure complexity**
   - Single file (simple instructions/examples)
   - Multi-file (scripts, templates, extensive docs)

5. **Tool restrictions**
   - Full access (default)
   - Restricted (allowed-tools field for read-only or limited scope)

### Phase 2: Description Crafting

The description determines discoverability. Use this proven formula:

```
[Specific operations] + [When to use] + [Trigger terms]
```

**Example walkthrough**:
- ❌ "Helps with documents" (too vague)
- ✅ "Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction."

**Key elements**:
1. **Specific operations**: List concrete actions (extract, analyze, generate, validate)
2. **When to use**: Scenarios and contexts (when working with X, during Y, for Z tasks)
3. **Trigger terms**: Exact words users would say (PDF, forms, commit message, data analysis)

See [examples/descriptions.md](examples/descriptions.md) for more patterns.

### Phase 3: Name Validation

Validate and format the name:

- Convert to lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove invalid characters (only allow: a-z, 0-9, -)
- Ensure max 64 characters
- Make it descriptive but concise

**Examples**:
- "My PDF Tool" → "my-pdf-tool"
- "Code Reviewer!!!" → "code-reviewer"
- "data_analysis" → "data-analysis"

### Phase 4: Structure Planning

**Single file** when:
- Instructions and examples fit comfortably in one file
- No scripts or utilities needed
- Straightforward workflow

**Multi-file** when:
- Extensive documentation (split into reference.md)
- Scripts or utilities needed (scripts/ directory)
- Templates or boilerplate (templates/ directory)
- Many examples (examples.md)

Recommended structure for complex Skills:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # Core instructions (loaded first)
├── reference.md       # Detailed API/reference (loaded if needed)
├── examples.md        # Additional examples (loaded if needed)
├── scripts/           # Utility scripts
│   ├── helper.py
│   └── process.sh
└── templates/         # Template files
    └── template.txt
```

### Phase 5: Implementation

#### Create the directory

```bash
# Personal Skill
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/skill-name

# Project Skill
mkdir -p .claude/skills/skill-name

# Multi-file structure
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/skill-name/{templates,scripts,examples}
```

#### Write SKILL.md

Template structure:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: [Use the formula from Phase 2]
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob  # Optional: only if restricting tools
---

# Skill Name

Brief introduction explaining what this Skill does.

## Quick Start

Provide the most common use case with a concrete example.

## Instructions

Step-by-step guidance for Claude:

1. [First step with specific actions]
2. [Second step with expected behavior]
3. [Continue pattern]

## Examples

Show concrete code examples:

```language
# Example code that demonstrates usage
```

## Best Practices

- Key principle or pattern
- Important consideration
- Common pitfall to avoid

## Requirements

List any dependencies:
```bash
pip install required-package
```
```

#### Add supporting files if multi-file

Reference from SKILL.md:
```markdown
For detailed API reference, see [reference.md](reference.md).

Use the helper script:
```bash
python scripts/helper.py input.txt
```
```

### Phase 6: Validation

Before finalizing, check:

- [ ] Description follows formula (what + when + triggers)
- [ ] Description under 1024 characters
- [ ] Name is lowercase-with-hyphens, under 64 chars
- [ ] YAML has opening and closing `---`
- [ ] YAML uses spaces not tabs
- [ ] Instructions are clear and actionable
- [ ] Examples are concrete and tested
- [ ] Dependencies are documented
- [ ] Tool restrictions (if any) are appropriate

See [reference/validation-checklist.md](reference/validation-checklist.md) for complete checklist.

### Phase 7: Testing

1. **Restart Claude Code** (required for Skills to load)

2. **Test discovery**:
   - Ask using trigger terms from your description
   - Verify Skill activates automatically
   - Try variations of trigger phrases

3. **Test workflow**:
   - Follow instructions as Claude
   - Verify all examples work
   - Check edge cases

4. **Debug if needed**:
   ```bash
   # Check Skill was loaded
   # Ask: "What Skills are available?"

   # View Skill file
   cat ~/.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md

   # Check for YAML syntax errors
   claude --debug
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Skill doesn't activate

**Causes**:
1. Description too vague
2. Trigger terms don't match user's words
3. YAML syntax error
4. Didn't restart Claude Code

**Solutions**:
1. Make description more specific with exact trigger terms
2. Add more synonyms and related terms
3. Validate YAML (check --- delimiters, spaces not tabs)
4. Restart Claude Code

### Issue: Skill activates when it shouldn't

**Causes**:
1. Description too broad
2. Overlapping with other Skills

**Solutions**:
1. Narrow description scope
2. Add specific context (file types, operations)
3. Consider splitting into focused Skills

### Issue: YAML syntax errors

**Common mistakes**:
- Missing opening `---` (line 1)
- Missing closing `---` (before Markdown content)
- Using tabs instead of spaces
- Unquoted strings with special characters

**Fix**:
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Description text here
---

# Markdown starts here
```

## Iteration and Improvement

After using a Skill, improve it:

1. **Track activation patterns**: Does it activate when expected?
2. **Gather feedback**: What's confusing or missing?
3. **Refine description**: Add trigger terms from actual usage
4. **Expand examples**: Add real scenarios encountered
5. **Update instructions**: Clarify ambiguous steps

## Educational Principles

When creating Skills, remember:

**Why descriptions matter**: Claude uses them for discovery. Vague descriptions = never activated.

**Why multi-file structure works**: Progressive loading. Claude reads SKILL.md first, supporting files only when needed. Keeps context focused.

**Why tool restrictions are powerful**: Creates safe, focused Skills. Read-only analysis Skills can't accidentally modify files.

**Why trigger terms are crucial**: Users don't know your Skill exists. They ask questions naturally. Trigger terms bridge their words to your Skill.

## Quick Templates

Basic Skill template: [templates/basic-skill.md](templates/basic-skill.md)

Advanced multi-file template: [templates/advanced-skill.md](templates/advanced-skill.md)

Description examples: [examples/descriptions.md](examples/descriptions.md)

## Tips for Great Skills

1. **Be specific in descriptions** - exact operations, file types, scenarios
2. **Include trigger synonyms** - users say things differently
3. **Start simple, expand later** - single file first, add complexity when needed
4. **Test with real requests** - use actual words users would say
5. **Document dependencies clearly** - don't assume packages are installed
6. **Provide concrete examples** - show don't tell
7. **Make instructions actionable** - specific steps, not vague guidance
8. **Consider scope carefully** - personal for experimentation, project for team
9. **Use tool restrictions wisely** - read-only Skills for analysis/review
10. **Iterate based on usage** - refine trigger terms from real activation patterns

## Next Steps

After creating a Skill:

1. Share with team (if project Skill, commit to git)
2. Document in project CLAUDE.md if it's a pattern others should know
3. Create related Skills for connected workflows
4. Consider packaging multiple Skills as a plugin for wider distribution

---

**Remember**: Great Skills have specific descriptions with trigger terms. That's the difference between a Skill that gets used and one that never activates.
