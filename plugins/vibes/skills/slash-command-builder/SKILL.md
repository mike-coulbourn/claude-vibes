# Slash Command Builder

Create effective custom slash commands for Claude Code with proper structure, dynamic features, and best practices.

## Quick Reference

**Command File Location**:
- Project (shared): `.claude/commands/name.md`
- Personal (individual): `~/.claude/commands/name.md`

**Dynamic Features**:
- Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS` (all) or `$1`, `$2`, `$3` (positional)
- Bash execution: !\\\`command\\` (requires `allowed-tools: Bash(...)`)
- File references: `@path/to/file`

**Frontmatter**: Optional YAML with `description`, `allowed-tools`, `argument-hint`, `model`

## The Slash Command Creation Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

Use AskUserQuestion to understand what they need:

1. **What should the command do?**
   - What task or prompt does it automate?
   - What's the expected outcome?

2. **Who will use it?**
   - Just you (personal command)
   - Your team (project command)

3. **Does it need dynamic inputs?**
   - Fixed prompt (no arguments)
   - User-provided values (arguments needed)
   - Context from system (bash execution)
   - File contents (file references)

4. **What tools should it access?**
   - Read-only analysis (Read, Grep, Glob)
   - Git operations (Bash(git:*))
   - Full access (default, no restrictions)

### Phase 2: Choose Scope

**Personal Command** (`~/.claude/commands/`):
- Your individual shortcuts
- Experimental commands
- Personal workflow automation
- Not shared with team

**Project Command** (`.claude/commands/`):
- Team-shared commands
- Standardized workflows
- Committed to git
- Available to all team members

### Phase 3: Design the Structure

Basic command structure:

```markdown
---
description: Brief description for /help
allowed-tools: Optional tool restrictions
argument-hint: Optional argument guidance
---

[Your prompt here]
```

**Decision tree**:
1. Start with basic prompt
2. Add arguments if needed ($ARGUMENTS or $1/$2)
3. Add bash execution if context needed (!\\\`command\\`)
4. Add file references if analyzing files (@path)
5. Add frontmatter for description and restrictions

### Phase 4: Implementation

#### Step 1: Create the file

```bash
# For project commands
touch .claude/commands/your-command.md

# For personal commands
touch ~/.claude/commands/your-command.md
```

The filename (without .md) becomes the command name.

#### Step 2: Write the command

Use templates from [templates/](templates/) directory:
- [basic-command.md](templates/basic-command.md) - Simple prompt
- [with-arguments.md](templates/with-arguments.md) - With dynamic inputs
- [with-bash.md](templates/with-bash.md) - With bash execution
- [with-files.md](templates/with-files.md) - With file references
- [complex-command.md](templates/complex-command.md) - All features combined

#### Step 3: Add frontmatter (recommended)

```yaml
---
description: What this command does (appears in /help)
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob  # Optional restrictions
argument-hint: [arg1] [arg2]     # Optional user guidance
---
```

### Phase 5: Testing

1. **Verify command appears**:
   ```
   /help
   ```
   Look for your command in the list.

2. **Test basic invocation**:
   ```
   /your-command
   ```

3. **Test with arguments** (if applicable):
   ```
   /your-command arg1 arg2
   ```

4. **Test bash execution** (if applicable):
   - Verify commands execute
   - Check output appears in prompt

5. **Test file references** (if applicable):
   - Verify files load correctly
   - Check paths resolve

6. **Team testing** (for project commands):
   - Have teammates try it
   - Gather feedback
   - Iterate based on usage

### Phase 6: Iteration

Start simple, add complexity incrementally:

1. **First**: Basic prompt without dynamic features
2. **Test**: Verify it works
3. **Add**: One feature (arguments OR bash OR files)
4. **Test**: Verify new feature works
5. **Repeat**: Add next feature if needed

Don't try to add all features at once. Build incrementally.

## Common Command Patterns

### Pattern 1: Code Analysis

```markdown
---
description: Analyze code for [specific criteria]
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
argument-hint: [file-or-directory]
---

Analyze @$1 for:
1. [Criterion 1]
2. [Criterion 2]
3. [Criterion 3]

Provide specific findings with examples.
```

### Pattern 2: Git Workflow

```markdown
---
description: [Git operation] with context
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*)
---

## Current State

Branch: !\\\`git branch --show-current\\`
Status: !\\\`git status --short\\`

## Task

[What to do with this context]
```

### Pattern 3: Code Generation

```markdown
---
description: Generate [artifact] following patterns
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Write
argument-hint: [what-to-generate]
---

## Existing Patterns

@[relevant examples]

## Task

Generate $ARGUMENTS following the patterns above.
```

### Pattern 4: Deep Analysis

```markdown
---
description: Deep analysis of [topic]
---

Think deeply about $ARGUMENTS considering:
1. [Aspect 1]
2. [Aspect 2]
3. [Aspect 3]

[Extended thinking triggered by keywords]
```

## Real-World Examples

See [examples/](examples/) for complete working examples:
- [git-workflows.md](examples/git-workflows.md) - Commit, PR, branch commands
- [code-analysis.md](examples/code-analysis.md) - Review, security, performance
- [code-generation.md](examples/code-generation.md) - Tests, docs, boilerplate

## Advanced Features

### Arguments: $ARGUMENTS vs $1/$2

**Use `$ARGUMENTS`** when:
- You want all input as a single block
- Free-form text (messages, descriptions)
- Don't need to reference parts separately

**Use `$1`, `$2`, `$3`** when:
- You need structured parameters
- Different parts used in different places
- Want to provide defaults for missing args

Example:
```markdown
# $ARGUMENTS approach
Explain $ARGUMENTS in detail.

# Positional approach
Review PR #$1 with priority $2 assigned to $3.
```

### Bash Execution

Execute commands BEFORE the prompt runs:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*)
---

Current branch: !\\\`git branch --show-current\\`
Recent commits: !\\\`git log --oneline -5\\`
```

**Requirements**:
1. Must include `allowed-tools: Bash(...)`
2. Use !\\\`command\\` syntax (backticks required)
3. Output is captured and included in prompt

**Security**: Limit bash access with specific tool patterns:
```yaml
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*)          # Git only
allowed-tools: Bash(npm:*), Bash(git:*)  # npm and git
```

### File References

Include file contents with `@` prefix:

```markdown
Review @src/auth/login.js for security issues.
```

**Features**:
- Automatic CLAUDE.md inclusion from file's directory hierarchy
- Works with relative or absolute paths
- Directories show listing (not contents)

### Frontmatter Configuration

Complete frontmatter options:

```yaml
---
description: Brief description (required for /help and SlashCommand tool)
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash(git:*)  # Optional restrictions
argument-hint: [file] [priority]              # Optional guidance
model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022              # Optional model override
disable-model-invocation: false               # Optional, prevent auto-calling
---
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always include description**
   - Helps team understand command purpose
   - Required for SlashCommand tool
   - Appears in `/help`

2. **Use argument-hint for clarity**
   - Shows expected inputs
   - Self-documenting commands
   - Reduces user confusion

3. **Limit allowed-tools when appropriate**
   - Read-only commands: `Read, Grep, Glob`
   - Git-only: `Bash(git:*)`
   - Enhances security and safety

4. **Structure complex commands**
   - Use sections (Context, Task, Constraints)
   - Makes prompts easier to understand
   - Follows clear flow

5. **Reference project conventions**
   - Include `@CLAUDE.md` for standards
   - Reference example files
   - Ensures consistency

6. **Test incrementally**
   - Start simple, add features one at a time
   - Test each addition before next
   - Don't debug multiple features simultaneously

7. **Organize with subdirectories**
   - Group related commands
   - Cleaner file structure
   - Easier to maintain

8. **Commit project commands**
   - Share with team via git
   - Version control for commands
   - Team benefits from your work

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Command doesn't appear in /help

**Causes**:
- File not in correct location
- Missing .md extension
- Filename has invalid characters

**Solutions**:
- Check file is in `.claude/commands/` or `~/.claude/commands/`
- Verify `.md` extension
- Use lowercase-with-hyphens for filename

### Issue: Arguments not replacing

**Causes**:
- Typo in placeholder (`$ARGUMENT` instead of `$ARGUMENTS`)
- Not passing arguments when invoking
- Wrong syntax

**Solutions**:
- Double-check spelling: `$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`, `$2`
- Test with: `/command arg1 arg2`
- Verify placeholder exists in template

### Issue: Bash commands not executing

**Causes**:
- Missing `allowed-tools: Bash(...)` in frontmatter
- Wrong syntax (missing backticks)
- Command fails when run

**Solutions**:
- Add frontmatter: `allowed-tools: Bash(command:*)`
- Use correct syntax: !\\\`command\\`
- Test command in terminal first

### Issue: File references not working

**Causes**:
- Missing `@` prefix
- File doesn't exist
- Wrong path

**Solutions**:
- Use `@path/to/file` syntax
- Verify file exists: `ls path/to/file`
- Try absolute path if relative fails

## Slash Commands vs Skills

**When to use each**:

| Use Slash Commands | Use Skills |
|---|---|
| Manual invocation (you decide when) | Automatic discovery (Claude decides when) |
| Simple prompt templates | Complex multi-file workflows |
| Quick, focused operations | Broad capabilities |
| Single .md file | Directory with multiple files |

**Example**:
- Slash command: `/commit` - You invoke when ready to commit
- Skill: `skill-builder` - Claude discovers when you mention Skills

Both complement each other in your workflow.

## Tips for Effective Commands

1. **Start with the simplest version** that works
2. **Add complexity only when needed** (YAGNI principle)
3. **Test with real scenarios** before sharing
4. **Include clear descriptions** in frontmatter
5. **Use tool restrictions** for safety
6. **Reference project conventions** with file refs
7. **Gather context** with bash execution
8. **Structure prompts** with clear sections
9. **Provide examples** in argument-hint
10. **Iterate based on usage** - improve over time

## Next Steps

After creating a command:

1. **Test thoroughly** with various inputs
2. **Share with team** (if project command)
3. **Document in CLAUDE.md** if it's a pattern others should know
4. **Create related commands** for connected workflows
5. **Refine based on feedback** - commands improve with use
