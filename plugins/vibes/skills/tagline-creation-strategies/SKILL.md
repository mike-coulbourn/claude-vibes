# Tagline Creation Strategies

Quick reference for creating memorable, strategic taglines using proven methodologies from expert copywriters and brand strategists.

> "Your brand isn't what you say it is. It's what they say it is." — Marty Neumeier

## Key Distinction: Trueline vs Tagline

| Type | Purpose | Audience | Example (Nike) |
|------|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Trueline** | Internal compass that guides decisions | Internal team | "Helps you find your inner athlete" |
| **Tagline** | Public-facing "sexy" formulation | Customers | "Just Do It" |

**How They Work Together**:
- Start with the trueline to nail positioning
- Craft the tagline as its public expression
- The trueline informs; the tagline performs

---

## The 7-Step Professional Process

1. **Internal Brand Audit**: Collect brand assets, attributes, benefits, differentiators
2. **Competitive Analysis**: Review competitors' taglines for differentiation opportunities
3. **Audience Research**: Understand needs, wants, challenges, aspirations
4. **Extensive Brainstorming**: Generate 100+ options (where the magic happens)
5. **Distillation**: Write USP fully → cut by half 3x → apply linguistic device
6. **Evaluation & Shortlist**: Whittle to 5-7 candidates with objective feedback
7. **Testing & Vetting**: A/B test, check trademark conflicts, test across mediums

> "If there is magic in the tagline creation process, brainstorming is where it happens."

---

## The Distillation Method

The most practical technique for creating taglines:

1. **Write your USP** in as many words as necessary
2. **Cut the word count in half** (first pass)
3. **Cut it in half again** (second pass)
4. **Cut it in half a third time** (third pass)
5. **Apply a linguistic device** (rhyme, alliteration, parallelism)

## Tagline Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Descriptive** | Describes offering, benefits, or promise | "Save money. Live better." (Walmart) |
| **Emotional** | Appeals to feelings | "Because You're Worth It" (L'Oreal) |
| **Aspirational** | Inspires achievement | "Impossible is nothing" (Adidas) |
| **Imperative** | Call to action | "Just Do It" (Nike) |
| **Superlative** | Positions as the best | "The Best a Man Can Get" (Gillette) |
| **Interrogative** | Uses a question | "Got Milk?" |
| **Provocative** | Thought-provoking | "Think Different" (Apple) |

**Expert Recommendation**: "To hit emotional triggers, prioritize differentiation taglines or results-driven taglines."

---

## Tagline Formulas

Proven structural patterns:

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **[Verb] + [Noun]** | "Think Different" |
| **[Action] + [Benefit]** | "Eat Fresh" |
| **[Empowering Word] + [X]** | "Rethink [X]", "Imagine [X]" |
| **[Number] + [Benefit]** | For specific claims |
| **"The [Only/Best] [X] that [Y]"** | Superlative positioning |
| **Question Format** | "What's in your wallet?" |

## Linguistic Devices for Memorability

These devices have roots in oral tradition—they helped memorize stories across generations:

| Device | Example | Why It Works |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Rhyme** | "The quicker picker-upper" (Bounty) | Phonetic patterns are easier to encode |
| **Alliteration** | "The best a man can get" (Gillette) | Repeated sounds create rhythm |
| **Parallelism** | "Go green, Go Ford" | Structural patterns aid recall |
| **Sensory Language** | "Finger lickin' good" (KFC) | Activates more brain areas |
| **Rhythm** | "Just Do It" (Nike) | The brain is "a sucker for rhythm" |

---

## Psychology of Memorability

### Key Statistics

- Most **liked** slogans: **4.9 words** average
- Most **recalled** slogans: **3.9 words** average
- Tourism slogans: **3.64 words** average
- Optimal tagline length: **2-7 words** (never more than 7-8)

### The Likability vs. Memorability Trade-off

> "Easily liked slogans are often forgettable. Memorable slogans challenge the audience with uncommon words, concrete imagery, or complexity. To remember something, we must think about it."

Find the sweet spot: memorable enough to stick, likable enough to resonate.

### Emotional Triggers

| Trigger | Example | Mechanism |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Identity Alignment** | "Think Different" (Apple) | Appeals to who people ARE or aspire to be |
| **Aspiration** | "Just Do It" (Nike) | Connects with motivation and empowerment |
| **Self-Worth** | "Because You're Worth It" (L'Oreal) | Taps into desire for validation |
| **Sensory Experience** | "The Ultimate Driving Machine" (BMW) | Promises physical/emotional exhilaration |

## Famous Tagline Lessons

### Nike: "Just Do It" (1988)

**Created by**: Dan Wieden (night before client presentation)
**Initial reception**: "We don't need that shit" — Wieden insisted: "Just trust me on this one"
**Lesson**: Great taglines often face initial resistance. Conviction matters.

### Apple: "Think Different" (1997)

**The quirk**: "Think Different" not "Think Differently" — grammatical incorrectness creates distinctiveness
**Lesson**: Emotional positioning can be more powerful than feature-dense messaging.

### L'Oreal: "Because You're Worth It" (1971)

**The innovation**: Among the FIRST taglines to focus on women's self-worth
**Lesson**: Emotional benefits often outweigh functional ones.

### BMW: "The Ultimate Driving Machine" (1974)

**Results**: U.S. sales from 13,000 to over 90,000 in a decade
**Lesson**: "Superlative" taglines can work when backed by genuine product excellence.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Being Too Generic** | "Quality you can trust" — could be any brand | Use the Onlyness Test |
| **Using Clichés/Jargon** | Technical terms aren't common language | Use everyday words |
| **Neglecting Customer Benefits** | Features without "so what?" | Focus on what's in it for THEM |
| **Overcomplicating** | Too many words, too many ideas | Distillation Method: cut by half 3x |
| **Being Overly Clever** | People remember the wit, forget the brand | "Rather than clever, be direct and clear" |
| **Copying Others** | Confuses customers, risks legal trouble | Onlyness Test |
| **Cultural/Translation Failures** | Pepsi's "Brings you back to life" → "Brings ancestors from grave" in Chinese | Test internationally |
| **Disconnection from Brand** | Tagline doesn't match actual experience | Align with trueline |
| **Ignoring Medium Constraints** | Works on billboard, not on business card | Test across contexts |
| **Not Testing** | Launching with untested assumptions | A/B test, focus groups |
| **Including Brand Name** | Research shows it feels "too sales-y" | Keep tagline separate |

## Testing Frameworks

### AIDA Evaluation

Test whether your tagline achieves:
- **A**ttention: Does it grab attention?
- **I**nterest: Does it sustain interest?
- **D**esire: Does it create desire?
- **A**ction: Does it prompt action?

### ABC Test

Is your tagline:
- **A**uthentic: True to your brand
- **B**elievable: Credible, not overpromising
- **C**ustomer-Oriented: Focused on their benefit

### Key Metrics to Evaluate

| Metric | Question |
|--------|----------|
| **Memorability** | Can people recall it after seeing once? |
| **Clarity** | Do they understand what it means? |
| **Emotional Response** | What feelings does it evoke? |
| **Brand Fit** | Does it align with brand identity? |
| **Differentiation** | Does it stand out from competitors? |

### The Onlyness Test

Can you complete this sentence in a way no competitor can?

**"Our [OFFERING] is the only [CATEGORY] that [BENEFIT]."**

If a competitor's name could substitute and the statement still works, your positioning needs work.

## Expert Frameworks

### Eugene Schwartz's 5 Levels of Awareness

Tailor your tagline approach based on where your audience is:

| Level | Description | Tagline Approach |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Most Aware** | Knows product, ready to buy | Direct, product-focused |
| **Product-Aware** | Knows product, not convinced | Benefit-focused |
| **Solution-Aware** | Knows solutions exist, not yours | Differentiation-focused |
| **Problem-Aware** | Has problem, doesn't know solutions | Problem-agitation then solution |
| **Completely Unaware** | Doesn't recognize the problem | Start with identity or aspiration |

### David Ogilvy's 8 Headline Principles

1. Headlines should be complete advertisements
2. Include the brand name (debated—see modern research)
3. Avoid tricky headlines (no puns or literary allusions)
4. Be clear and direct (everyday language)
5. Use specific numbers ("5%" beats "less than you might suppose")
6. Optimal length: 6-12 words for headlines, 2-7 for taglines
7. Avoid negative words (readers may skip the "not")
8. News headlines work best (announce something new)

### Scott Bedbury's Brand Mantra Framework

A three-word internal sentence that captures brand meaning:

**Structure**: [Emotional Modifier] + [Descriptive Modifier] + [Brand Function]

**Examples**:
- Nike: "Authentic Athletic Performance"
- Disney: "Fun Family Entertainment"

A brand mantra is NOT a tagline—it's an internal compass that guides decisions. But it can inspire tagline direction.

4. **"Copy cannot create desire — it can only channel existing desire."** — Eugene Schwartz
5. **Shorter is almost always better**: Aim for 2-4 words, never more than 7-8
6. **The most recalled taglines average 3.9 words** — Research finding
7. **Emotional impact matters more than word count**
8. **Clarity beats cleverness every time**
9. **Position first, tagline second** — Get positioning right before crafting
